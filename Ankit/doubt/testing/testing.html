	<p>Hemsworth was born in Melbourne,[5] to Leonie (née van Os),[6] an English teacher, and Craig Hemsworth, a social-services counsellor.[7][8] He is the middle of three boys; his brothers Luke (older) and Liam (younger) are also actors. His maternal grandfather is a Dutch immigrant and his maternal grandmother is of Irish descent;[9] he also has English, Scottish, and German ancestry.[6] He was raised both in Melbourne and in the Australian Outback in Bulman, Northern Territory. He has stated, "My earliest memories were on the cattle stations up in the Outback, and then we moved back to Melbourne and then back out there and then back again. Certainly most of my childhood was in Melbourne but probably my most vivid memories were up there [in Bulman] with crocodiles and buffalo. Very different walks of life."[5] He attended high school at Heathmont College[5] before his family again returned to the Northern Territory, and then moved a few years later to Phillip Island.</p>
